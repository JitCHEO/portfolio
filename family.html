				<h1>My family</h1>
				<p>I was born in Malaysia and arrived in Australia as an international student. Initially, I pursued aircraft maintenance engineering, but due to difficulties in finding a job, I decided to explore another path and obtained a certification in electrotechnology to become an electrician. In 2019, I began my degree in Electrical Engineering, but later decided to temporarily pause my studies to focus on a different career direction. Along the way, I started a family here in Australia and am blessed with an incredible wife and two adorable, playful boys aged 5 and a half and 2 and a half.</p>
